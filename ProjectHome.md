This is NOT a PDF rendering library. It aims at providing a scripting tool to generate and analyze malicious PDF files. As well, it can be used to create on-the-fly customized PDFs, or to inject (evil) code into already existing documents.
<ul>
<blockquote><li> Create PDF documents from scratch. </li>
<li> Parse existing documents, modify them and recompile them. </li>
<li> Explore documents at the object level, going deep into the document<br>

names and strings. </li>
<li> High-level operations, such as encryption/decryption,<br>

<li> A GTK interface to quickly browse into the document<br>
contents.</li>
